## How It Works

### 1. Image Upload
- Users can drag & drop or browse to select a photo
- Supports common image formats (PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, BMP)
- Files are temporarily stored with unique identifiers

### 2. Skin Detection
- Implements RGB-H-CbCr skin detection algorithm
- Uses multiple color space criteria for accuracy:
  - RGB conditions for basic color filtering
  - CrCb conditions for skin tone identification
  - Hue conditions for additional validation

### 3. Color Analysis
- Converts detected skin pixels to LAB color space
- Calculates average skin color values
- Generates color swatches for visualization

### 4. Foundation Matching
- Compares skin color against foundation database
- Uses Delta E 76 formula for color difference calculation
- Ranks matches by compatibility score
- Provides quality ratings (Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, Poor)

## Professional Color Calibration

### X-Rite ColorChecker Integration

The application supports professional-grade color calibration using X-Rite ColorChecker charts. This dramatically improves color accuracy and provides lighting-independent results.

#### Features:
- **Automatic Chart Detection**: Computer vision algorithms automatically locate ColorChecker charts
- **Manual Corner Selection**: Fallback option for challenging lighting conditions
- **Multiple Delta E Methods**: Support for Delta E 76, 94, and 2000 calculations
- **White Balance Correction**: Automatic white balance using neutral patches
- **Gamma Correction**: Precise gamma curve calculation
- **Calibration Profiles**: Save and load calibration settings
- **Quality Metrics**: Real-time validation and quality scoring

#### Calibration Process:
1. **Upload ColorChecker Image**: Take a photo including the ColorChecker chart
2. **Chart Detection**: Automatic detection or manual corner selection
3. **Validation**: Quality assessment of detected color patches
4. **Calibration**: Calculate transformation matrices and correction factors
5. **Application**: All subsequent analyses use calibrated color conversion

#### Benefits:
- **±1-2 Delta E accuracy** (vs ±5-10 without calibration)
- **Lighting independence** - works under various illuminants
- **Device calibration** - accounts for camera characteristics
- **Scientific traceability** - follows CIE standards
- **Professional results** - comparable to spectrophotometer measurements

#### Technical Implementation:
- **ColorChecker Detection**: Contour analysis and perspective correction
- **Color Transformation**: Least squares optimization for calibration matrices
- **Chromatic Adaptation**: Bradford transform for illuminant changes
- **CIE Color Conversion**: Accurate sRGB ↔ XYZ ↔ LAB transformations

## Foundation Database

The application includes an extensive simulated foundation database with:
- 8 tone categories (Very Fair, Fair, Light, Light Medium, Medium, Medium Deep, Deep, Very Deep)
- 3 undertone variations per shade (Cool, Neutral, Warm)
- 100+ total foundation shades
- Real brand names (Fenty Beauty, Rare Beauty, NARS, MAC, Charlotte Tilbury, etc.)
- Accurate LAB color values for each foundation
- Comprehensive shade range covering all skin tones

## Color Science Background

### LAB Color Space
- **L***: Lightness (0-100)
- **a***: Green-Red axis (-127 to +127)
- **b***: Blue-Yellow axis (-127 to +127)

### Delta E Calculation
Delta E represents the perceptual difference between two colors:
- **ΔE < 1**: Excellent match (barely perceptible difference)
- **ΔE < 2**: Very good match (slight difference)
- **ΔE < 3**: Good match (noticeable but acceptable)
- **ΔE < 5**: Fair match (clearly noticeable difference)
- **ΔE ≥ 5**: Poor match (significant difference)

## Usage Tips

### For Best Results:
- Use natural lighting when taking photos
- Ensure face is clearly visible
- Minimal or no makeup
- High resolution images
- Avoid shadows on the face

### Before Purchasing:
- Test foundation in natural lighting
- Check that undertones match your skin
- Consider your skin type (oily, dry, combination)
- Ask for samples when possible
